# When a Mongoose met a MicroPython

Mongooses and very small pythons can coexist, and even be friends.

This is more a framework than an actual application, with it you can integrate [MicroPython](https://www.micropython.org/) and Cesanta's [Mongoose](http://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/). Mongoose runs when called by MicroPython and is able to run Python functions as callbacks for the events you decide in your event handler. The code is completely written in C, except for the example Python callback functions, of course. To try it, you can just build this example on a Linux machine, and, with just a small tweak, you can also run it on any ESP32 board.
